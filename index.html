I am actively engaged in the development of cutting-edge algorithms and systems that leverage various approaches, including traditional computer vision and machine learning, to automate specific tasks. My experience has taught me how to tackle complex problems and break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. I have also took part in the user interface integration of the projects. In addition to my technical skills, I am a highly adaptable professional who embraces teamwork, but also enjoys working independently. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills and learn from my colleagues, while also taking ownership of individual tasks and responsibilities. Throughout my career, I have collaborated with a diverse range of professionals, from medical doctors to software engineers, to deliver successful projects that exceed expectations.</p> </body></html>
