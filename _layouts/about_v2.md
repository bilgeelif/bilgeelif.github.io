As a computer vision research engineer, my focus lies in the domain of medical image R&D projects. I am actively engaged in the development of cutting-edge algorithms and systems that leverage various approaches, including traditional computer vision and machine learning, to automate specific tasks.

My experience has taught me how to tackle complex problems and break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. I have also taken part in the user interface integration of the projects, ensuring that sophisticated algorithms are accessible through intuitive interfaces.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a highly adaptable professional who embraces teamwork, but also enjoys working independently. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills and learn from my colleagues, while also taking ownership of individual tasks and responsibilities.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated with a diverse range of professionals, from medical doctors to software engineers, to deliver successful projects that exceed expectations. This interdisciplinary approach has strengthened my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to various stakeholders.
