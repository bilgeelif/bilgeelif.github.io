Spectral karyotyping is a molecular cytogenetic method used to detect structural changes in chromosomes of cells. Spectral karyotype refers to the classification of chromosomes based on their size, shape, genetic characteristics, and the chromosome colors obtained through different staining techniques. This technique is used to stain the genetic material at specific regions of chromosomes with different colors. These colors are then arranged in a spectrum, and chromosomes are grouped and classified based on their position on the spectrum. This is a technique used in the diagnosis and research of genetic diseases. In this method, matching for spectral karyotyping (SKY) is done according to a reference color palette, and each chromosome is labeled with a specific color corresponding to its spectral signature. Colors are assigned according to a pre-defined spectral library that includes the spectral signatures of all chromosomes in the organism under study.
