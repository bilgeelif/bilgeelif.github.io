Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis is an immunological assay method that involves the binding of a specific antibody to a target molecule and the use of a fluorescent marker to determine the location of the target molecule. In this method, a specific antibody, called the primary antibody, binds to the target molecule, and a fluorescent secondary antibody is then used to determine the location of the target molecule. The secondary antibody specifically binds to the primary antibody and carries a fluorescent marker, allowing the target molecule to be visualized with fluorescent light. This analysis method is used to determine the presence of specific antibodies on targeted cells, tissues, or organisms.
