Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis is an immunological method where a specific antibody binds to a molecule of interest, and a fluorescent marker is used to locate the molecule. In this technique, a primary antibody binds to the target molecule, while a secondary antibody labeled with a fluorescent marker is used to locate the target. By binding to the primary antibody, the secondary antibody illuminates the target molecule under fluorescent light. This method is used to identify specific antibodies on chosen cells, tissues, or organisms. In this task, a reference image is captured and marked as positive due to the presence of antinuclear antibody. The classification of the test image depends on assessing its similarity or dissimilarity with the reference image.

<!-- 
Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis is an immunological assay method that involves the binding of a specific antibody to a target molecule and the use of a fluorescent marker to determine the location of the target molecule. In this method, a specific antibody, called the primary antibody, binds to the target molecule, and a fluorescent secondary antibody is then used to determine the location of the target molecule. The secondary antibody specifically binds to the primary antibody and carries a fluorescent marker, allowing the target molecule to be visualized with fluorescent light. This analysis method is used to determine the presence of specific antibodies on targeted cells, tissues, or organisms.
