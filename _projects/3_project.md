HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a protein that assists in the growth and division of cancer cells. HER2 classification refers to the expression level of HER2 protein on the surface of a cancer cell. In breast cancer, overexpression of HER2 or excessive HER2 protein on the surface of cancer cells is associated with a more aggressive form of the disease. HER2 classification is used to categorize breast cancer into four categories: HER2-negative (class 0), HER2-equivocal (class 1), and HER2-positive (low (class 2) and high expression (class 3)).

The following visuals presents the result for a selected area by the user on a Immunohistochemistry(IHC), belonging to which HER2 category in percentage.
