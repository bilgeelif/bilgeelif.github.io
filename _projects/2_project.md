Tumor budding is a pathological feature where individual cancer cells separate from a tumor mass and are dispersed in surrounding tissue. It is considered a prognostic factor for the likelihood of metastasis (the spread of cancer to other parts of the body) and is generally associated with a more aggressive type of cancer. 

This has been the most challenging study and I have learned the most, as the definition of tumor budding is still vague so this makes the materials on the subject are very limited and the evaluation of tumor buds is very open to the subjective evaluations of pathologists. Since the definition of tumor budding is still unclear, even the labeling of tumor budding may be an entirely different work, so studies on this topic may initiate clarification in definitions. But I believe that such studies on this subject may initiate the clarification in definitions.
